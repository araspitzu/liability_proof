# Proof of Liabilities

*Proof of Liabilities* Scala implementation.

Proof of Liabilities (PoL) is a scheme designed to let companies that accept
monetary deposits from consumers (e.g. Bitcoin exchanges, gambling websites,
online Bitcoin wallets, etc.) prove their total amount of deposits (their liabilities)
without compromising the privacy of individual users.
